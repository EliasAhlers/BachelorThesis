This thesis explores the use of Large Language Models for classifying and transferring between German-language proficiency levels. By employing prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques on the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model, I achieved significant improvements in CEFR classification accuracy compared to previous methods. The thesis also investigates the challenging task of transferring texts between CEFR levels while preserving content. My findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in language assessment and text adaptation, outperforming traditional approaches. I also identify limitations and areas for future research, including the need for larger datasets and refined evaluation metrics for text transfer tasks.
